# Explainable Multi-Agent Supervised Learning

This repository contains an implementation of the paper [Explainability and Interpretability of an Ensemble Multi-Agent System for Supervised Learning](). This implementation aim at provinding a reproducible implementation of the described multi-agent system.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

This repository features two jupyter notebooks:

- [learning-comparison.ipynb](learning-comparison.ipynb): contains an example learning process with visualizations.
- [simple-learning.ipynb](simple-learning.ipynb): contains a comparative experiment with other machine learning algorithms.
